// --------------- Data objects for result validation ---------------

/**
* The classes in this category are built to make sure that if you would
* maybe have a function that could return no result or a result, you get
* all the data in the same object.
*
* To use them, instead of returning a nullable type or a simple variable type as float, you can
* set these matching types instead. By default they are set to be "correct". So, you initialize them with their constructor
* with no parameters and if there is no result or an error, you can set "correct" to false and set an error message.
* If there is a result, you simply put it inside the "value" attribute.
* This makes it so you will still receive a coherent answer from your function.
*
* The word correct is used instead of valid to make it easier to distinguish between the words "valid" and "value".
*/

/**
* This class is the generic version of all the next classes.
* It can be filled with any variable type.
* Although the way to create it is more complex, it includes every types.
* Examples to use this class is in examples/result_objects.cs at the "TResult<T> class example" section.
